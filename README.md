# AngularNotesApp
User facing app with no server side scripting
I have google many times while making this app. It was a great learning experience. You can even this repo for learning purposes. 
For getting a mediocre hand over AngularJS framework, follow these steps...

1) Read some basics theory about angular for (half an hour is enough)
2) Start with some basic syntaxes and directives (1-2 hours)
3) Start making the this app (4-5 days with debugging)

*NOTE: On my blog at http://www.dstartupkid.com , in coming few days, I am going to provide the proper basic tutorials for helping you in above steps.

Once you do all this, you will get some idea about what AngularJS is and how it works. This much is enough to get you well started with this framework. You will eventually learn more complex things after this.

All the best!! :)
